      " .In aggregate, although overall lead times for the iPhone 16 models are still lower relative to iPhone 15 last year, the narrowing of the gap between the two groups (Base versus Pro) over the previous week and steady lead times for the Pro models highlight the likelihood that the initial slower momentum in demand for the Pro models is correcting itself with the release of Apple Intelligence drawing closer.\n",

      "2024-09-30 14:00:02+00:00 Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is still the second most valuable company on the planet, narrowly beaten by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n",
      " all these, some require very aggressive projections or accept a low margin of safety to justify the valuation, such as Tesla, where it is necessary to consider substantial increases in fundamentals through the FSD, or Apple where the high price-to-earnings does not go well with growth prospects, but this is not really the case with Microsoft.\n",
      ".Warning! .Even though it is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio very similar to Apple's, Microsoft is expected to grow faster and has very solid competitive advantages that guarantee good sustainability, and it is also possible to benefit from various opportunities since its revenue is very diversified.\n",
      " .What bothers me is that while it's easy to understand scenarios where the company grows close to 15% over the next few years, it's difficult to perpetuate this for a few decades. Doing the same with Apple, the price-to-earnings for fiscal year 2026 would be ~27.2x, a higher level even if it is driven by large buybacks.\n",
      " .Historically, Microsoft has traded at a higher multiple than Apple, but in recent years this gap has been narrowing. In the latest data, Microsoft stocks were trading at 31.8x earnings, while Apple was trading at 30.5x, and although both are excellent companies with good prospects and competitive advantages, Microsoft's growth is a little more reliable (and will probably be higher at least in the short and medium term). It's also worth noting that Apple is trading at a higher premium compared to its own history since the mean of its indicator is ~21.3x while Microsoft's is 26.8x.\n",
      "2024-09-30 13:52:59+00:00 According to Morgan Stanley analysts, lead times for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models are stabilizing and even extending, marking an unexpectedly positive development.\n",
      ".The bank said that as of September 27, iPhone 16 lead times remain shorter than those seen in the last three iPhone cycles, but the recent stabilization of the iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max models is noteworthy.\n",
      ".\"At T+14, iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max lead times have both extended by 2 days vs. T+11, vs. iPhone 14&15 Pro/Pro Max lead times contracting 4-5 days at this point,\" Morgan Stanley analysts stated.\n",
      " .This elongation suggests that the iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max demand trajectory is more closely aligned with the successful iPhone 12 and 13 cycles rather than the weaker iPhone 14 and 15 models.\n",
      " .\"We are seeing this same trend internationally too, with lead times for the iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max extending by ~2 days, on average, vs. last Tuesday in all regions but Chin,\" the bank said.\n",
      " Stanley added that this extension resembles the trajectory seen with the iPhone 12 and 13 models, which also experienced elongating lead times due to supply chain disruptions. However, no such disruptions have been reported for the iPhone 16 models.\n",
      " .Although Apple recently adjusted its wafer orders at TSMC, Morgan Stanley does not believe this reflects softening demand for the iPhone 16.\n",
      " .\"Apple likely has excessive processor inventories,\" the analysts pointed out, emphasizing that the wafer adjustment is not a direct indication of current demand trends.\n",
      " .While Morgan Stanley's view on the iPhone 16 cycle remains unchanged, they are closely watching this emerging trend of stabilizing lead times as a potentially positive indicator.\n",

      " .Lead times for the iPhone 16 are shorter than in recent years, according to investment firms. As of September 24, average lead times in the U.S. for the iPhone 16 stand at 15.2 days, down from 25.7 days for the iPhone 15 last year and 18 days for the iPhone 14 in 2022.\n",

      ".Globally, the trend is similar, with average lead times for the iPhone 16 at 16.3 days, compared to 28.5 days for the iPhone 15. However, this year, wait times for the iPhone 16 haven’t shown the same uptick as in previous launches.\n",
      " .UBS suspects demand might stay below expectations until the rollout of iOS 18.2 in November, which will introduce more AI features. The update, iOS 18.1, is set for mid-October and will showcase some of these features. While it’s early to draw firm conclusions from lead times, Woodring suggests the outlook for iPhone builds leans more negative than positive, despite reports of strong initial demand from some regions like India.\n",
      " every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features.\n",
      " .However, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This trend isn’t great for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? .However, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n",
      ".“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) gained but detracted from relative performance due to our underweight. While the company’s overall and iPhone revenues declined year over year, the unveiling of an upgraded iPad Pro and iPad Air boosted investor sentiment.

      " .Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n",
      ".Brad Gerstner’s Stake: $57,155,950\n",
      ".Talking to CNBC in June, Brad Gerstner said:\n",
      ".“Clearly, Apple with a billion users is going to play a significant role in introducing AI to the masses. And part of the reason we like Apple is only 5% of Apple users today can access Apple Intelligence so they are going to have to upgrade these devices in order to play.”\n",
      ".However, initial numbers on Apple’s new iPhone are not encouraging. Shipments for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest iPhone 16 appear to be lower than last year, according to data from UBS Evidence Lab. The lab tracks iPhone availability across 30 regions, and UBS analyst David Vogt noted that delivery wait times for the iPhone 16 Pro Max models are about two weeks shorter than last year in major markets like the U.S., China, and Europe.\n",
      " .Story continues\n",
      ".“Wait times for the iPhone 16 lineup have been uninspiring since preorders began last Friday,” said UBS analyst David Vogt, in an investor note. Despite the upcoming Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence features, initial pre-order sales for the iPhone 16 series are estimated at 37 million units, down 12.7% year-over-year.\n",
      " every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features.\n",
      " .However, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This trend isn’t great for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? .However, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n",
      ".“The Fund’s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but\n",
      ".in Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple’s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.\n",
      " .This quarter we increased the size of our position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on-device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”\n",

The new phone debuted with a lot of hype around Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) believes will change the way consumers interact with phones altogether. Initial demand figures for the phone paint a confusing picture, but Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has dismissed concerns around slower growth projections, reiterating in a recent investor note that with the introduction of artificial intelligence, a number of camera upgrades and better battery life as part of the iPhone 16, it was possible the iPhone 16 upgrade cycle topped 90 million units on initial launch. Ives further claimed that the launch of the iPhone 16 was the start of an AI driven supercycle, and throughout fiscal 2025, Apple could sell more than 240 million units of the phone.\n",
