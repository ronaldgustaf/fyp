The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) and T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS), as well as a micro-cap stock Tucows Inc. (TCX).  The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

Shares of Apple have gained +18.8% over the year-to-date against the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry’s gain of +19.5%. The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth.

Apple expects the September quarter’s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as of June quarter on a year-over-year basis. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.

Introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher. However, weakness in iPhone sales particularly in China is a concern.

Tesla’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the year-to-date period (+4.9% vs. +1.8%). Amid competition intensifying in the EV space the company focus on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be a game changer. It aims to launch affordable vehicles, transition into an AI company and is banking on its robotaxi venture.

The expected rollout of Tesla-supervised Full Self Driving (FSD) software in China and Europe by the end of the year will boost prospects. Additionally, TSLA’s Energy Generation and Storage business is thriving. While near-term challenges persist, long-term prospects appear promising, driven by its big bet on driverless software and AI.

Of late, Tesla has been plagued by shrinking automotive margins amid aggressive price cuts and discounts. The company expects its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 to be noticeably lower than 2023 amid a cooling electric vehicle (EV) market.

Shares of T-Mobile US have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the year-to-date period (+30.0% vs. +29.9%). The company is benefiting from industry-leading postpaid customer growth with a record-low churn rate. In the second quarter, the company added 1.3 million postpaid net customers while postpaid net account additions were 301,000, both metrics being the best in the industry.

TMUS’ 2.5 GHz 5G spectrum delivers superfast speeds and extensive coverage with signals that go through walls and trees. This boosts its competitive edge against the companies that provide 5G networks controlled by the mmWave spectrum.

However, owing to the stock’s premium valuation, we believe investors should remain cautious as macroeconomic factors, market saturation, or economic downturns can significantly impact overvalued stocks like TMUS. The high debt burden is a concern. Stiff competition is straining profitability. We are reiterating our Neutral recommendation.

Tucows’ shares have gained +8.3% over the past year against the Zacks Internet - Content industry’s gain of +14.7%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $230.64 million continues to see strong subscriber growth, with a 25% year-over-year increase to 48,200 in second-quarter 2024. Revenues rose 17% to $14.6 million, supported by expanding infrastructure.

Ting’s gross margin grew 39% year over year, reflecting cost management and efficiency gains. The company completed a $63-million asset-backed securitization, helping fund its fiber expansion while reducing capital risk.

However, rising debt and liquidity concerns due to declining cash raise risks. Depreciation costs and challenges in customer acquisition add pressure as Ting competes with larger ISPs. Additionally, Tucows Domains saw a 3% decline in transactions, and continued pressure in this stable business could affect the overall performance. Slower fiber network expansion and increasing competition can hinder growth.

China has gone all out to stimulate the domestic economy and a slew of measures the government and the central bank proposed has kickstarted a strong rally in the domestic stock market. CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer weighed in on the development and recommended a few stocks that could be potential beneficiaries.

What Happened: “The Chinese are, once again, stimulating and everyone’s back,” said Cramer in a post on X, formerly Twitter. He also recommended Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Starbucks Corp. (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) for those looking for stimulus plays.

In a separate post, Cramer said he would love for China to set up a stock stabilization fund and use it to cushion any downside in stocks.

On Monday, the Chinese Shanghai Composite Index settled 8.06% higher 3,336.50 after Caixin manufacturing and services sector purchasing managers’ indices disappointed to the downside. The index has gained nearly 22% since Sept. 20 and is up about a little over 12% for the year.

The People’s Bank of China announced last week it will in the near future cut the reserve requirement ratio, which is the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves, by 50 basis points freeing up about 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) for new lending, Reuters reported.

The central bank hinted at the possibility of reducing it by an incremental 0.25-0.50% points. The PBoC also said it would lower the seven-day repo rate by 0.2 points, the interest rate on a medium-term lending facility by about 30 basis points and loan prime rates by 20-25 basis points.

Why It’s Important: For Apple, China is a key market both from the perspective of supply and demand. Cupertino counts China as its major manufacturing base despite its efforts to diversify its production base. China is also a key market for the company’s consumer electronics products, specifically its iPhone, and its services business. Of late, Apple has been stymied by domestic competition that is flooding the market with cheaper smartphones. Huawei has re-emerged as a key rival for Apple in the Chinese smartphone market.

Coffee chain retailer Starbucks has a strong presence in China. The weakening of economic fundamentals in China has impacted the company’s sales in recent quarters. In the June quarter, Starbucks’ same-store sales in China fell 14% compared to a more modest 2% drop in the U.S.

Alibaba’s fortunes are closely tied to the Chinese economy as it generates the bulk of its e-commerce sales from China.

Apart from Cramer’s recommendation, a Chinese economic revival may also bode well for commodity and energy stocks and those multinational corporations have a big presence in the country such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

The iShares MSCI China ETF (NYSE:MCHI) rallied 3.35% to $52.70 in premarket trading on Monday, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2024-09-30 17:09:08+00:00,Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Demand Correction In Sight: Analyst Highlights Delivery Trends Across Global Markets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-iphone-16-pro-demand-170908351.html,"Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Demand Correction In Sight: Analyst Highlights Delivery Trends Across Global Markets

JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee maintained an Overweight rating on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a price target of $265.

In the third week of Chatterjee’s Apple Product Availability Tracker, delivery lead times are showing trends, which, if continued, will explain the weaker lead times for the Pro models in the initial weeks as only an aberration led by a combination of better supply mix and delay in picking up momentum from higher-end consumers awaiting the release of Apple Intelligence, he noted.

The analyst said lead times, in the aggregate, have moderated as expected following the peak in the second week.

Still, Pro-model lead times remained steady for week three, contrary to the typical moderation in prior years.

Base models led the moderation in the last week for iPhone 16 series in aggregate, while lead times for Pro models were stable; iPhone 16 (Base model) moderated by seven days (versus moderation of 1 day from the second week to third week last year for iPhone 15), with moderation of 11 days for the Plus model (versus moderation of 1 day from second week to third week last year for 15 Plus), but lead times for Pro and Pro Max held steady over the last week relative to moderation of 7 days and nine days, respectively, from second week to third week for 15 Pro and Pro Max.

In aggregate, although overall lead times for the iPhone 16 models are still lower relative to iPhone 15 last year, the narrowing of the gap between the two groups (Base versus Pro) over the previous week and steady lead times for the Pro models highlight the likelihood that the initial slower momentum in demand for the Pro models is correcting itself with the release of Apple Intelligence drawing closer.

As per Chatterjee’s U.S. Tracker, delivery lead times stabilized for Pro models while Base model lead times were moderate. The U.S. accounts for ~32% of iPhone shipments.

As per the analyst’s China Tracker, delivery lead times dropped drastically for 16 Plus and moderately for 16 while remaining stable for Pro models. China accounts for ~20% of iPhone shipments.

As per his Europe Tracker, lead times for Base models were moderate, while Pro lead times were stable, similar to other geographies. Germany and the U.K. each account for ~5% of iPhone shipments.

Price Action: AAPL stock is up 1.81% at $231.92 at last check Monday.

2024-09-30 14:00:02+00:00,How Microsoft's Diverse Growth Justifies Its Valuation,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsofts-diverse-growth-justifies-valuation-140002961.html,"Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is still the second most valuable company on the planet, narrowly beaten by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Among the 10 largest companies in the United States, some stand out for being traded at above-market multiples, such as the two already mentioned, but also Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE:LLY) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).

Of all these, some require very aggressive projections or accept a low margin of safety to justify the valuation, such as Tesla, where it is necessary to consider substantial increases in fundamentals through the FSD, or Apple where the high price-to-earnings does not go well with growth prospects, but this is not really the case with Microsoft.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MSFT.

Even though it is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio very similar to Apple's, Microsoft is expected to grow faster and has very solid competitive advantages that guarantee good sustainability, and it is also possible to benefit from various opportunities since its revenue is very diversified.

Microsoft's diverse revenue streams and strong competitive moats

Microsoft divides its revenue sources into three main ones: Productivity and Business Processes, which is the portion that encompasses Office Commercial, Office Consumer, LinkedIn, and Dynamics business solutions, represented 31% of revenue in FYQ4; Intelligent Cloud, which encompasses server products and cloud services such as Azure, Visual Studio, GitHub and others, represented 44% of revenue in the last quarter; and finally, More Personal Computing, which corresponds to revenue generated by Windows, Gaming (Xbox and the like), search and news, represented 25% of revenue in the last quarter.

Note that even if we divide the revenues into three, there are an infinite number of sub-segments within each one, and although they have divergent perspectives, the vast majority are good businesses that manage to make significant progress in terms of revenue and still do so steadily, supported by the competitive advantages of each one.

Windows, for example, is present on more than 70% of desktops, and with this data alone, it would be possible to compile a list of competitive advantages, such as gains in scale, cross-selling power, lock-in effect, better compatibility, and so on. Not to mention Office 365 and its applications, which are used by thousands of huge companies that need to use Microsoft products on a daily basis, not only on Windows, but also on Macs and cell phones, and although there are alternatives that could threaten this market share - such as the tools from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) - the level of loyalty is very high.

Story continues

These characteristics reflect directly on Microsoft's fundamentals, with the power to improve its recurring revenue, pass on inflation to the price of its services, grow on other fronts, the company has been able to grow its revenue per share by an average of 12.2% and its EPS growth by 20.9% over the last 20 years, while in the same period, EPS growth was 20.9%, also showing the improvement in net income margin. How Microsoft's Diverse Growth Justifies Its Valuation

Source: GuruFocus

With these moats and stability, it is already possible to infer that Microsoft deserves a multiple at least in relation to the average of its market, for differing in quality.

Microsoft's pathways to future growth

In the most recent quarter (Fiscal Q4), this positive trend continued, with Microsoft growing all three of these main revenue lines by double digits, resulting in a consolidated growth of 15%. Drilling down a little further, the highlights were server products and cloud services, which increased by 21%, and Xbox content and services, which increased by 61% but were impacted by the Activision acquisition, while Office Consumer products only increased by 3%. How Microsoft's Diverse Growth Justifies Its Valuation

Source: Microsoft's presentation

For the next few years, these good figures will continue (depending on the year and the analyst, it could even be more optimistic in fact). According to the forecast, the average revenue growth for the next 3 fiscal years is ~14.3% and for EPS this is even better, with growth of just over 15% and reaching $17.98 EPS in fiscal year 2026.

Constructing a scenario where Microsoft maintains growth close to 15% is quite reasonable. I'd even say easy. Its more traditional part, Productivity and Business Processes, has the capacity to maintain price adjustments, continue acquiring new customers, and also benefit from secular trends in productivity, cybersecurity, and AI, since the trend is for Office 365 to become increasingly complete and integrated.

More personal computing should be driven by trends such as the new Copilot PCs that can help increase sales, improve the operating system update cycle, and the like. Copilot subscriptions alone could also show significant growth over the next few years, especially with a view to more widespread adoption.

The cloud division, which is already the largest part of revenue, also has secular trends and is still one of the pillars for the advance of Artificial Intelligence. In the last earnings call, it was mentioned that the Azure AI customer base reached 60,000 customers, growing 60% YoY.

Some more macro trends, such as the acquisition of customers in emerging markets and small and medium-sized businesses that don't yet have access to these products and services, could also continue to drive the growth of Microsoft's financials.

What bothers me is that while it's easy to understand scenarios where the company grows close to 15% over the next few years, it's difficult to perpetuate this for a few decades. It is possible for a company that already has revenues of close to $250bn and a net income of almost $90bn to continue growing at an accelerated rate, but this may become increasingly difficult. New ventures, for example, will need to mature more and more if they are to make any difference to annual growth, and at some point, it may become more difficult to acquire new customers around the world.

Microsoft's high valuation is justifiable

Considering the growth mentioned in the previous section, in a few years this premium would already become something closer to the index average, taking the average of the 2026 EPS estimates, the price-to-earnings would be just over 24x, a value that seems quite reasonable considering that we are talking about one of the most consolidated companies in the world and one that still has a lot to grow. Doing the same with Apple, the price-to-earnings for fiscal year 2026 would be ~27.2x, a higher level even if it is driven by large buybacks.

Historically, Microsoft has traded at a higher multiple than Apple, but in recent years this gap has been narrowing. In the latest data, Microsoft stocks were trading at 31.8x earnings, while Apple was trading at 30.5x, and although both are excellent companies with good prospects and competitive advantages, Microsoft's growth is a little more reliable (and will probably be higher at least in the short and medium term). It's also worth noting that Apple is trading at a higher premium compared to its own history since the mean of its indicator is ~21.3x while Microsoft's is 26.8x. How Microsoft's Diverse Growth Justifies Its Valuation

Source: GuruFocus

As the scenario for Microsoft's growth is clearer and the company continues to be one of the main players that will benefit from the AI trend, this premium in relation to both the market and its own history seems reasonable to me. Another factor that supports the bullish thesis is that there may be positive surprises along the way, especially considering the company's good track record of management, capital allocation, and the like.

This valuation level is even better justified considering the quality. Microsoft is a unique company and ends up being barely comparable with the market average and even with the US Treasury. Many investors may prefer to expose themselves to the 10-year treasury which is paying ~3.7% than to buy Microsoft which has an earnings/market cap ratio of ~2.7%, but it is necessary to consider that by fiscal year 2026, this earnings yield should exceed 4%.

Traditionally, a DCF should consider a more robust equity risk premium, so for Microsoft's current price to work in a DCF model, it is necessary to either consider that it will be able to maintain growth of ~15% for two decades, or discount this cash flow at a very small rate (like 5% or 6%).

In short, there isn't a huge asymmetry or bargain here, but you can still justify Microsoft's price without too much trouble.

The bottom line

In view of the information above, although Microsoft is far from undervalued, its valuation can be well justified without overly optimistic assumptions or giving up the entire margin of safety. Of course, here the investor is trading upside for quality and stability but still exposing himself to a growth company that could surprise positively in various segments over the next decade, which could then become an interesting option for adding predictability to the portfolio.

The bank said that as of September 27, iPhone 16 lead times remain shorter than those seen in the last three iPhone cycles, but the recent stabilization of the iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max models is noteworthy.

""At T+14, iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max lead times have both extended by 2 days vs. T+11, vs. iPhone 14&15 Pro/Pro Max lead times contracting 4-5 days at this point,"" Morgan Stanley analysts stated.

This elongation suggests that the iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max demand trajectory is more closely aligned with the successful iPhone 12 and 13 cycles rather than the weaker iPhone 14 and 15 models.

""We are seeing this same trend internationally too, with lead times for the iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max extending by ~2 days, on average, vs. last Tuesday in all regions but Chin,"" the bank said.

Morgan Stanley added that this extension resembles the trajectory seen with the iPhone 12 and 13 models, which also experienced elongating lead times due to supply chain disruptions. However, no such disruptions have been reported for the iPhone 16 models.

Although Apple recently adjusted its wafer orders at TSMC, Morgan Stanley does not believe this reflects softening demand for the iPhone 16.

""Apple likely has excessive processor inventories,"" the analysts pointed out, emphasizing that the wafer adjustment is not a direct indication of current demand trends.

While Morgan Stanley's view on the iPhone 16 cycle remains unchanged, they are closely watching this emerging trend of stabilizing lead times as a potentially positive indicator.

2024-09-30 13:28:31+00:00,Apple (AAPL) iPhone 16 Lead Times Starting to Alarm Wall Street Analysts as Bull Case Cracks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-aapl-iphone-16-lead-132831944.html,"We recently published a list of 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.

Chris Hyzy, Merrill & Bank of America Private Bank chief investment officer, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that there is “ a lot of momentum” behind the market rally. The analyst said that to gauge how much momentum we have behind the optimism, we need to analyze the “wedge” in the market.

“The biggest wedge that was in the market last year and in 2022 was inflation. That’s beginning to go away. It’s almost to the fact that no one’s is talking about whether or not we are going to have inflation that’s worrisome.”

Hyzy said that the Fed easing its fiscal policy and now China “joining the party” will be two key tailwinds for the market.

Answering a question about the hard landing vs soft landing debate, the analyst said we should look beyond the two possibilities as he believes there are many other scenarios to consider in between these two outcomes.

“We have a lot of components of a soft landing. I’d like to say it’s more of a mid-cycle slowdown with easier financial conditions that should actually create a profit revision to the upside not downside,” Hyzy added.

For this article we picked top 10 trending AI stocks on the back of latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 184

More and more Wall Street analysts are starting to realize that the much-hyped demand for iPhone 16 might never be realized and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in a different world now.

Lead times for the iPhone 16 are shorter than in recent years, according to investment firms. Morgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring points out that while supply has improved and there are some signs of strong demand, it’s wise to remain cautious. As of September 24, average lead times in the U.S. for the iPhone 16 stand at 15.2 days, down from 25.7 days for the iPhone 15 last year and 18 days for the iPhone 14 in 2022.

Story continues

Globally, the trend is similar, with average lead times for the iPhone 16 at 16.3 days, compared to 28.5 days for the iPhone 15. UBS analysts echo these findings, noting that typically, wait times for high-end models like the Pro and Pro Max increase as demand stabilizes. However, this year, wait times for the iPhone 16 haven’t shown the same uptick as in previous launches.

UBS suspects demand might stay below expectations until the rollout of iOS 18.2 in November, which will introduce more AI features. The update, iOS 18.1, is set for mid-October and will showcase some of these features. While it’s early to draw firm conclusions from lead times, Woodring suggests the outlook for iPhone builds leans more negative than positive, despite reports of strong initial demand from some regions like India.

Almost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features.

However, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years. This suggests that people are holding onto their devices longer, likely due to economic factors, satisfaction with current technology, or a lack of exciting new features in recent models. This trend isn’t great for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Can Apple Intelligence break this trend? We’ll find out soon.

However, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38

Parnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:

“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) gained but detracted from relative performance due to our underweight. While the company’s overall and iPhone revenues declined year over year, the unveiling of an upgraded iPad Pro and iPad Air boosted investor sentiment. In particular, the introduction of generative AI features allayed concerns that Apple was not keeping pace with competitors.”

Overall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

2024-09-30 12:59:26+00:00,Was Brad Gerstner Wrong About Apple’s (AAPL) AI Potential?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brad-gerstner-wrong-apple-aapl-125926424.html,"We recently published a list of Top 10 Favorite AI Stocks of Brad Gerstner. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 10th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.

Brad Gerstner, the founder of Altimeter Capital, has been a major believer in AI and tech stocks in general. Recently, the 53-year-old hedge fund manager shared some interesting data points highlighting the importance of tech stocks during an interview with Scott Galloway’s YouTube channel.

“Since 2014 technology earnings have compounded at 16% and technology stocks have compounded at 18%. Non-tech earnings have compounded at about 4% and stocks at about 6%. So if you look at the long run of technology since 2005 it’s gone from 5% of global GDP to 15% of global GDP,” Gerstner said.

Gerstner, whose firm manages about $10 billion in assets, emphasized during the interview that the risk of not investing in AI is higher than the risk of investing. He was addressing the market concerns about ROI on AI spending.

“As a professional investor, we’re just trying to determine what level of asymmetry what level of enthusiasm or exuberance is baked into these stocks and what are we seeing day to day in terms of usage and revenues out of the consumer,” he said.

For this article we scanned Altimeter Capital’s Q2 portfolio and discussed its biggest AI stock picks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Brad Gerstner’s Stake: $57,155,950

Talking to CNBC in June, Brad Gerstner said:

“Clearly, Apple with a billion users is going to play a significant role in introducing AI to the masses. And part of the reason we like Apple is only 5% of Apple users today can access Apple Intelligence so they are going to have to upgrade these devices in order to play.”

However, initial numbers on Apple’s new iPhone are not encouraging. Shipments for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest iPhone 16 appear to be lower than last year, according to data from UBS Evidence Lab. The lab tracks iPhone availability across 30 regions, and UBS analyst David Vogt noted that delivery wait times for the iPhone 16 Pro Max models are about two weeks shorter than last year in major markets like the U.S., China, and Europe.

“Wait times for the iPhone 16 lineup have been uninspiring since preorders began last Friday,” said UBS analyst David Vogt, in an investor note. “On average, delivery wait times for the Pro Max models are shorter by roughly 2 weeks across the US, China, Germany, Great Britain, France and Japan.”

In the U.S., wait times are 26 days, down from 40 days last year, while in China, they’re just 18 days compared to 36. Despite the upcoming Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence features, initial pre-order sales for the iPhone 16 series are estimated at 37 million units, down 12.7% year-over-year.

Almost every bullish case on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is built around this assumption: millions of people would rush to upgrade their iPhone because of AI features.

However, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been seeing a long-term decline in mobile carrier upgrade rates, especially postpaid, for several years.

Baron Technology Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:

“The Fund’s chief relative detractor was Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even though it was a meaningful contributor to absolute performance, as we added to our Apple position significantly during the period. We bought Apple well, but

in 20/20 hindsight we didn’t buy enough. Because Apple has an oversized weight in the Benchmark (its average weight was 15.7% for the period), when Apple’s stock outperforms (it appreciated 23.0%), it has generally been a headwind to relative performance. Our Apple underweight accounted for 33% of our relative underperformance for the period.

This quarter we increased the size of our position in Apple Inc., a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on-device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”

2024-09-30 10:00:00+00:00,Warren Buffett Is Sending a $300 Billion Warning to Stock Investors,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-sending-300-billion-100000375.html,"Warren Buffett has a 70-year track record of producing market-trouncing returns for anyone willing to invest alongside him.

His Buffett Partnership Ltd. produced an annualized return of 31.6% from 1957 through 1968, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average compounded at a rate of 9.1%. He ultimately folded BPL into Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), which he took over in 1965, continuing to produce returns that left the rest of the market in the dust. Through 2023, Buffett's increased the value of Berkshire shares at an average rate of 19.8%, versus 10.2% for the S&P 500 in that period.

So, when Buffett makes an investment decision, the whole world pays attention. Buffett's made several big decisions during the past few quarters regarding Berkshire's investment portfolio. They all add up into a significant warning for stock investors, indicating there's not a lot to like in the stock market right now.

Buffett's amassed a cash and Treasury bill position that approached $300 billion in the third quarter. There are several factors pushing Buffett's cash position to new records. Here's how we got here, and what it means for investors. Image source: The Motley Fool.

Buffett can't stop selling stocks

Buffett has sold more in stocks than he bought in each of the past seven quarters. The Oracle of Omaha made his biggest stock sale in history last quarter, when he cut Berkshire's position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) by about half of its remaining stake, or about $73 billion. Total equity sales through the first half of 2024 were $97 billion, while he made just $4.3 billion in new purchases.

The stock sales keep coming. Although we don't have final Q3 numbers yet, Securities and Exchange Commission filings indicate Buffett sold a large portion of Berkshire's investment in Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). Through Sept. 24, he sold $9 billion worth of shares.

Buffett has said that the decision to sell portions of Berkshire's investments in stocks like Apple or Bank of America is based on the idea that corporate tax rates will rise when the current tax law expires at the end of next year. Berkshire is sitting on enormous unrealized capital gains for both stocks, which have climbed considerably from Berkshire's original purchase prices from 2016 through 2018.

But Buffett's selling decision also implies that he thinks those stocks trade near or above their intrinsic value. If he thought they were undervalued, he'd be willing to pay higher taxes later to own an undervalued asset today.

That sentiment can broadly explain why Buffett has been less active on the purchasing side of the portfolio as well.

Story continues

Buffett's not even buying his favorite stocks

Buffett's favorite stock to purchase during the past few years, by far, has been Berkshire Hathaway itself. He's consistently bought back shares of the stock since the board of directors updated the repurchase authorization in 2018. Buffett now has the opportunity to buy back shares whenever he feels the stock is priced below its intrinsic value.

But last quarter's repurchases slowed to a snail's pace, totaling just $345 million. In June, Buffett elected not to buy any shares at all. And based on Berkshire's reporting in July, it doesn't look like he made any stock repurchases to start Q3. Considering Berkshire stock has since, for the most part, traded well above the levels it traded for in June and July, it's unlikely Buffett made significant repurchases in Q3.

Another favorite stock of Buffett's for the past few years is Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY). Buffett has been invested in the oil and gas company since 2019, when he acquired $10 billion in preferred shares of the company. He's gone on to buy 29% of the company's common stock, which means he has to file a disclosure with the SEC whenever he buys or sells shares of the company. But no such disclosures have materialized since June. That's despite the stock falling to new lows amid declining oil prices.

The cash is piling up fast

With $9 billion in gross stock sales from Bank of America alone during the quarter and limited capital deployed toward new stock purchases or buybacks, Berkshire's cash position is climbing quickly. As of the end of the second quarter, Buffett was already sitting on $277 billion in cash and Treasuries.

When you add in the operating cash flow from Berkshire's core operations of about $10 billion plus the interest earned on Berkshire's existing Treasury holdings, the cash position at Berkshire could easily top $300 billion. The one factor that might stop it from reaching that milestone is the estimated tax bill it had to pay this quarter on the huge stock sales Buffett executed earlier this year.

At this point, cash and Treasuries are approaching 50% of Berkshire Hathaway's investable assets. That's before you include the $169 billion in insurance float available to invest as well.

Buffett is showing a clear preference for safe assets and doesn't even like the valuation of his own company right now. The warning is clear for stock investors: There's not much to like in the stock market -- at least, not for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.

Should you follow Buffett's lead?

Remember, most individuals aren't managing a $600 billion investment portfolio. It's harder to maneuver a large ship than it is to steer a tiny speedboat. Buffett also has the challenge of producing above-market returns for shareholders. What's the value in buying Berkshire Hathaway stock if investors could effectively get the same returns from an S&P 500 index fund?

That is to say a lot of large-cap stocks that make up the investable universe for Berkshire Hathaway are unattractive at today's prices. That might even include Berkshire Hathaway stock itself. Buffett's lack of recent share repurchases suggests as much, at least.

But the investment universe is much larger for individual investors. Smaller stocks look particularly attractive from a valuation standpoint and could benefit from forthcoming interest rate cuts and growing money supply during the next few years.

While investors shouldn't ignore Buffett's warning, it's important to understand the implications. Just because Buffett doesn't have a lot of great investment options right now doesn't mean smaller investors can't put their money to work in the stock market.

AI is transforming industries and reshaping the world by enhancing efficiency, driving innovation, and opening up new economic opportunities. A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies — especially generative AI — has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 50% of healthcare providers will invest in AI-driven technologies to improve patient care, underscoring the potential for massive growth.

Financial services are also being transformed by AI. According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs.

The retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 184

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The company launched the latest model of the iPhone, dubbed iPhone 16, earlier this month. The new phone debuted with a lot of hype around Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) believes will change the way consumers interact with phones altogether. Initial demand figures for the phone paint a confusing picture, but Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has dismissed concerns around slower growth projections, reiterating in a recent investor note that with the introduction of artificial intelligence, a number of camera upgrades and better battery life as part of the iPhone 16, it was possible the iPhone 16 upgrade cycle topped 90 million units on initial launch. Ives further claimed that the launch of the iPhone 16 was the start of an AI driven supercycle, and throughout fiscal 2025, Apple could sell more than 240 million units of the phone.

Overall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this month. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
